# The Chessboard

This repository is a collection of short games and test files.   

The purpose of the chessboard, is to create a game with built in bugs that your player is unable
 to identify.   

The opponent will create test cases from a stub provided to them in an effort
 to identify these bugs.
 Should they find a bug that was unintentional, they win.
 Should they fail to find the **intentional** bugs, they lose.

# The Chessboard

#### Game Objective
The objective is simple: out-wit the opponent by hiding a set number of mistakes within the code.
 If the opponent catches the greater majority of the mistakes, they win.
 If the opponent finds an unintentional mistake, they win by default.   
Contrastly, if the opponent is unable to find the greater majority of the mistakes, you win (provided you made no 'real' mistakes).

#### Submission Rules
A minimum of three files should be submitted;
one containing stub code that outlines the purpose and details of each method
another containing the actual code
and a final markdown document, titled "Do-Not-Read," containing a written statement of the number of mistakes the code contains, as well as details regarding these mistakes. **THIS IS NOT TO BE READ BY THE OPPONENT**   
   
A minimum of 3 mistakes is required per submission, however, the maximum is up to the author's discretion.

#### Point System
Wins and losses are to be recorded in the Scoreboard, held in the main directory of the repository.   
The percentage of correctly identified mistakes will be recorded for each sumission under the player the submission was directed at (who identified the mistakes). 
 These percentages will be averaged to give a final score for each player.

###### The Calculation
`Number of Mistakes Found / Total Mistakes`    
   
_If a mistake is found that was not intended by the author, then the opponent is awarded a score of 100%._
